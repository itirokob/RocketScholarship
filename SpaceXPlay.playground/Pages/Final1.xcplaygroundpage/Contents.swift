# Space

 You've got to the end of the game!
 
 Congratulations for coming all this way! Facing failure isn't easy, is it? But still you made it till the end.
 
 This story was based in SpaceX's Falcon1 first launch. Like you, they only had funds for four launches and, like you did, they didn't stopped even after failing a few times and on the last try, Falcon 1 reached space!
 
 In the end, this is life. Great part of the times, we are going to fail, but the most important thing is to take the lesson learned and keep trying!
