 You've got to the end of the game!
 
 Congratulations for coming all this way! In life we have to make choices and sometimes giving up of somethings and priorizing others is important too!
 
 This story was based in SpaceX's Falcon1 first launch. They only had funds for four launches and they've failed for 3 times. It was on the last try that Falcon 1 finally reached space!
